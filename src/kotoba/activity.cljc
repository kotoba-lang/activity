  "Automatic work-time capture — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the class of product the fleet had
  no answer to: automatic timesheet capture (the Timely / Memtime / Rize /
  Clockk / DeskTime / RescueTime category). The pipeline is

      observations -> sessions -> attribution -> timesheet entries

  where each arrow is a pure function of its input. No network, no I/O, no
  clock — every function that needs the current time takes it from its
  caller, so a run is reproducible from its observations alone.

  `kotoba.labor` is the sibling that PRICES work time (contracts, wages,
  payroll). This library only ever says how much time was OBSERVED and
  what it was for; `->timesheet-entries` emits `:ts/*` maps shaped exactly
  like `kotoba.labor/timesheet` so the two compose without either
  depending on the other.

  Three invariants hold throughout and are what make the output usable as
  a billing basis rather than a guess:

    1. Time is never extrapolated. A session ends at its last observation,
       not at the next one's start and not at 'now'. Capture therefore
       undercounts by at most one sample interval per session, which is
       the safe direction.
    2. Unattributed time stays unattributed. Nothing in here spreads
       leftover minutes across projects to make a day add up.
    3. Rounding only ever goes down or to nearest. There is deliberately
       no :ceil — rounding up bills time nobody observed.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."

  A session's duration is `end - start`, i.e. the span actually observed.
  The dwell after the final sample is NOT extrapolated, so a session
  polled every 60s runs about one interval short of wall clock. That
  understates the day on purpose; the alternative inflates every session
  by however long the poller happened to sleep.
